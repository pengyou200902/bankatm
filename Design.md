# Abstract
Our program uses Model-View-Controller(-DAO) architecture, combined with PostgreSQL.
For DAO specifically, we use singleton.

The advantages are obvious. We can easily split the work. It's easy to decouple.

We first design the data structures(DB tables) for the objects that will appear in the program.
The Models are created for different tables of the database. The Views are the GUIs
for users to interact with. The Controllers are responsible for the logical processes
of data. The DAOs are responsible for communicating with the database, retrieving or 
updating the data.
